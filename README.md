# CVE-Alerts
Use NVDlib to scrape new CVEs posted on a given day and send an email with the results. Set this up in PythonAnywhere to run everyday on a set schedule and you can be informed of all new CVEs posted.

## About
Working in Cybersecurity can feel overwhelming at times, there are constant changes, and it can feel impossible to keep up to date. To ensure I am aware of critical and all vulnerabilities posted to the National Vulnerability Database, I wrote this script. The goal of the script was to get an email notification every day to show me all the new vulnerabilities posted but, also highlight those with a critical score.

## Setup
To get this up and running, you only really need to configure two things:
#### Email configurations
First, you need an email account that will be sending the notifications. For my use case I created a new Gmail account and for that I followed Lei Mao's guide on sending emails via Python. All credit for the email sending process goes to Lei Mao and I will leave the link to the page here: https://leimao.github.io/blog/Python-Send-Gmail/. As he highlights, you will need to grab an "App Password", search this in the settings search bar if it does not appear on the main account settings page. Make sure to insert the sender email address, recipients, and app password in the "setup for email" section. See below for reference.

#### Cloud setup/scheduled run
Now that the script is set up to search NVD and email you with newly posted vulnerabilities, you may want to set this up to run on a schedule. Now, there are a few ways of doing this. 
1. Set up a scheduled run on your Windows 10 machine and have it run that way, but this means your computer must be on. You could set up an old laptop as a server of sorts and have it always powered on, but, let's be honest - that's a hassle. 
2. Set it up in a cloud environment. There are plenty of options out there and depending on your needs, you may decide to go with another hosting provider but, I found PythonAnywhere to work great. I simply added the file to my "files" and then set it to run every day at a specific time via the "tasks" dashboard. Just remember the time is in UT, so you will need to convert to your timezone.

## Output
In the early stages of the scripts' development I had the output sent to the console, however since this is now running in a cloud environment it doesn't really make sense to have the output displayed. So to demonstrate what the output will looklike, I will share a screenshot of the email notification.

## CVE Scores
You may notice from the output above that the score can sometimes be shown as "None". This happens when a CVE is posted without a score assigned by the vendor and also does not have a CVE score from the NVD analysis yet as it is too new to have been analyzed.

## Disclaimer
Please note that I am not a professional programmer and this script is far from optimized. I am sure there is a much more efficient way to do this, but, it works for my use case. Also, I want to note that this project was made possible due to the countless other sources such as NVDlib documentation, Lei Mao's guide on email notifications in Python, GeekforGeeks tuple conversion function, and even ChatGPT which helped me solve the filtering issue I was having when trying to sort by critical CVEs, thanks GPT :)

Also, feel free to modify the script to better fit your needs. Remove the email notification feature and just see the output in your console. Change the start and end date and only receive notification at the end of the week highlighting all critical CVEs posted that given week. Do whatever will make this work best for you.
